            Monokuma is the headmaster of Hope's Peak Academy, which is a high school for students with ultimate talents who are the very best at what they do. When the students arrive Monokuma informs them that they're trapped in the school indefinitely where they can choose to live together forever in harmony.

            However there is one way to leave Hope's Peak which is referred to as the Graduation Clause. All you have to do is murder anoter student and get away with it. After a murder there will be a class trial. If the murderer or "blackened" is correctly identified then he or she will be executed. If the murderer is not correctly identified then they'll graduate and go free while everyone else will be executed instead.
